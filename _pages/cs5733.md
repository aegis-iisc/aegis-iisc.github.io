Program Synthesis: the problem of automatically generating programs from user requirements, is a classic problem in Computer Science. These requirements can be given in several ways like formal logical formulas, input-output examples and recently using higher-level
inputs like images and natural languages. The motivation for
program synthesis stems from the fact that it is often easier for the user to convey the intent of the
program, compared to writing the complete program. Additionally, synthesis can also help in
generating correct-by-construction programs. This can be particularly fruitful for tasks which are
error-prone and/or safety critical systems.

program synthesis sits at the intersection of Programming languages, automated reasoning and machine learning and the field has seen significant interest in recent years with recent developments in these areas. 

This course will offer a broad study of the theory and practice of program synthesis. We will cover different paradigms/variants of Program Synthesis techniques in the state-of-the-art, giving introduction to underlying principles required for each of these paradigms.
