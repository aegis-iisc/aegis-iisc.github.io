#### Overview

Program Synthesis, the problem of automatically generating programs from user requirements, is a classic problem in Computer Science. These requirements can take several forms like formal logical formulas, input-output examples, and more recently, using higher-level
inputs like images and natural languages. The motivation for synthesis stems from the fact that it is often easier for the user to convey the intent of the
program compared to writing the complete program. 
Additionally, synthesis can also help in
generating correct-by-construction programs, this can be particularly fruitful for tasks that are
error-prone and/or safety-critical systems.
Program synthesis sits at the intersection of programming languages, automated reasoning, and machine learning. This interdisciplinary nature of the field has sparked significant interest in recent years, with exciting developments in each of these areas.

This course will offer a broad study of the theory and practices of program synthesis. We will cover different classes of program synthesis techniques, like inductive synthesis vs. deductive synthesis, top-down vs. bottom-up, etc., and introduce underlying foundations for each class. The course will also cover major recent developments in the field, like type-driven synthesis, synthesizing domain-specific programs, and neuro-symbolic synthesis, combining ML and PL techniques for program synthesis.
