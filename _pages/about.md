#### About
Starting March 2024, I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [IIT Hyderabad](https://cse.iith.ac.in), where I am part of <span style="color:red"><b>ΣλMPL∃</b></span> (Simple) Lab. Before, I was a Postdoc at [PurPL](https://purduepl.github.io), Purdue, working with wonderful [Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). I also worked for an year on Program Analysis for JS with [Frank Tip](http://www.franktip.org/). I did my PhD at [IISc](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/), working with [Y. N. Srikant]().

My background is in Formal Methods and Programming Languages. My research views programming languages as the core machinery for problem solving. I am interested in developing scalable and automated **program synthesis** techniques ([Cobalt](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/OOPSLA23.pdf), [Cobb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06421), [Hegel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14614)); designing rich **type systems**, and **domain specific programming languages** ([Poirot](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/poirotpreprint.pdf), [Morpheus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07901v1)) and building **program analysis and verification** tools and techniques([Stubbifier](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/JESE.pdf)).

#### Research Interests

- **Program Synthesis**: 
	- Type-driven synthesis;
  - Scalable synthesis and repair; 
  - Neurosymbolic program synthesis;
  - Synthesisizing coverage-complete test generators.

- **Automated Program Verification**: 
	- Under-approximate Reasoning; Incorrectness Logic; 
  - Effects and Higher-Order programs; 
  - Program Analysis.
  
- **Functional Programming and Type Systhems**:
	-  Refinement Types, DSLs;
  -  Type Inference.


<span style="color:red">
I am always on the lookout for **motivated** PhD/M.Tech/B.Tech students to work with me. 
Please see the highlights of some of the [projects](/projects/) in our lab, and drop me an email if you find this interesting.</span>


#### Services
**PC Member** : ATVA '25, SAS '25, ECCOP '25, ISEC 25.
**Artifact Evaluation** : PLDI '25, OOPSLA '25.
