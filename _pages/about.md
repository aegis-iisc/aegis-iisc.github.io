I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Purdue University working with wonderful [Prof Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). Before this, I worked for a year on Program Analysis for JS with [Prof Frank Tip](http://www.franktip.org/). I did my PhD dissertation on _verifying behavioral properties of complex programs_ at [Indian Institute of Science, India](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/) under [Prof. Y. N. Srikant](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~srikant/).
  
I am interested in developing formal methods for software reliability and synthesis. In this context, I am especially interested in
developing automated program synthesis techniques and tools ([Cobalt](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/OOPSLA23.pdf)); designing richer types a([Coverage Types](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/poirotpreprint.pdf)) and domain specific programming languages ([Morpheus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07901v1)) and building program analysis and verification tools for JavaScript([Stubbifier](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/JESE.pdf)).


<!-- 
I am interested in developing techniques and tools to help developers build reliable, secure and efficient Software. In this context, I am especially interested in building program analysis and verification tools, designing programming languages, and developing automated program synthesis techniques for programs with effects, dynamic features and asynchronous semantics.

Recently, I have worked on developing a component-based program synthesis tool (**Cobalt**) to synthesize 
correct programs using effectful libraries. Previously, I have worked on designing a domain-specific language (**Morpheus**) with support for rich refinement types to reason about the correctness of effectful Parser Combinator programs. Before that, I also developed static and dynamic program analysis techniques for Android (**AsyncDroid**) and Javascript programs (**Stubbifier**).   -->
