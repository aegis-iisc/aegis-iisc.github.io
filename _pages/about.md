#### About
Starting March 2024, I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [IIT Hyderabad](https://cse.iith.ac.in). Before, I was a Postdoc at [PurPL](https://purduepl.github.io), Purdue, working with wonderful [Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). I also worked for an year on Program Analysis for JS with [Frank Tip](http://www.franktip.org/). I did my PhD at [IISc](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/), working with [Y. N. Srikant](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~srikant/).

My background is in Formal Methods and Programming Languages. My research views programming languages as having a central place in solving computing problems. I am interested in developing  automated program synthesis techniques and tools ([Cobalt](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/OOPSLA23.pdf)); designing richer type systems ([Poirot](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/poirotpreprint.pdf)), and domain specific programming languages ([Morpheus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07901v1)) and building program analysis and verification tools and techniques([Stubbifier](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/JESE.pdf)).
#### Research Interests

- **Program Synthesis**: 
	- Scalable Deductive Synthesis;
	- Synthesis for Program Repair; 
  - Neural+Symbolic (NeuroSymbolic) Synthesis.

- **Automated Program Verification**: 
	- Effects and Higher-Order programs; 
	- Under-approximate Reasoning; Incorrectness Logics; 
	- Program Analysis
  
- **Functional Programming**:
	-  Dependent and Refinement Types, DSLs.
  -  Refinement Types inference.

I try to write sometimes, on any topic which comes across my mind.

I am interested in developing techniques and tools to help developers build reliable, secure and efficient Software. In this context, I am especially interested in building program analysis and verification tools, designing programming languages, and developing automated program synthesis techniques for programs with effects, dynamic features and asynchronous semantics.

  

Recently, I have worked on developing a component-based program synthesis tool (**Cobalt**) to synthesize

correct programs using effectful libraries. Previously, I have worked on designing a domain-specific language (**Morpheus**) with support for rich refinement types to reason about the correctness of effectful Parser Combinator programs. Before that, I also developed static and dynamic program analysis techniques for Android (**AsyncDroid**) and Javascript programs (**Stubbifier**). -->
