#### About
Starting March 2024, I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [IIT Hyderabad](https://cse.iith.ac.in). Before, I was a Postdoc at [PurPL](https://purduepl.github.io), Purdue, working with wonderful [Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/). I also worked for an year on Program Analysis for JS with [Frank Tip](http://www.franktip.org/). I did my PhD at [IISc](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/), working with [Y. N. Srikant](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~srikant/).

My background is in Formal Methods and Programming Languages. My research views programming languages as having a central place in solving problems. I am interested in developing **scalable and automated** program synthesis techniques ([Cobalt](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/OOPSLA23.pdf), [Cobb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06421), [Hegel]()); designing rich **type systems**, and **domain specific programming languages** ([Poirot](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/poirotpreprint.pdf), [Morpheus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07901v1)) and building **program analysis and verification** tools and techniques([Stubbifier](https://aegis-iisc.github.io/assets/pdf/JESE.pdf)).

#### Research Interests

- **Program Synthesis**: 
	- Scalable Program Synthesis and Repair; 
  - Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis.

- **Automated Program Verification**: 
	- Under-approximate Reasoning; Incorrectness Logic; 
  - Effects and Higher-Order programs; 
  - Program Analysis.
  
- **Functional Programming**:
	-  Refinement Types, DSLs;
  -  Type Inference.



#### Services
**PC Member** : ATVA '25, SAS '25, ECCOP '25, ISEC 25.
**Artifact Evaluation** : PLDI '25, OOPSLA '25.


*I am always on the lookout for PhD/M.Tech/B.Tech students to work with me. 
Please drop me an email if you find the work interesting.*



#### Blog 
I try to write sometimes, on any topic which comes across my mind.
